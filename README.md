# GirlsSaveThePlanet171

Welcome to our data story: Food for Thought! Thank uou for taking 
the time to explore our work. <br />

First of all here are the links to our process book, final website,
github repository and screencast video:    
[process book](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_HBFrpurPWXwlk-gAp40DqYhMeO8n2IZ59-S-Ean_IU/edit?usp=sharing)  
[final website](https://karilu.github.io/GirlsSaveThePlanet171/)  
[github repository](https://github.com/karilu/GirlsSaveThePlanet171)  
[screencast](https://youtu.be/qg1lUjJjWLY)

At the highest level of our submission folder you will find this ReadMe file, our process book PDF,
a video of our screencast and a folder labeled "Final Project."  
The folder contains the project files from webstorm.
Our data can be found within the subfolder "data". The subfolders for
both js and css are futher divided into "libraries" and "ours" to make 
clear what we did and what we used.  

Our website can be navigated by scrolling with the arrow keys, or a mouse pad,
we found that its best to give each page a second to load before scrolling. Each
page also comes with instructions on how to interact with our visualizations.

The images used are not ours, we used royalty free images and the 
attribution for those wich required it can be found at the end of the website.

 
Best,

Karina and Victoria
